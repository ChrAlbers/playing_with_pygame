# Purpose

This is a repository where I put my stuff I try out with pygame under Python 3.6.
I am completely new to this, so my stuff is very basic.

### test_ball_grav_move.py

Trying out two things:
1. Have a ball bounce under the influence of gravity. Collisions are fully elastic, no loss of energy
2. Move the ball by applying acceleration upon keypress of arrow keys, left and right.
